| As a user, I want to be working with the data I have provided                                                                                                                                                                    | Get SQL database into a usable format | 1 | 2 |
| As a user, I want to be able to specify an area (and optionally a number n), and be given a list of either all, or only the first n, countries, cities, or capital cities in that area, sorted by population in descending order | Implement code to output report specified by user inputs | 2 | 3 |
| As a user, I want to be able to specify an area and be given the total population of the area, the total population of all cities in the area, and the leftover population which does not stem from cities                       | Implement code to output report specified by user inputs | 3 | 3 |
| As a user, I want to be able to specify an area and be given a numerical value of its population                                                                                                                                 | Implement code to output report specified by user inputs | 4 | 3 |
| As a user, I want to know the number of people who speak each of the five required languages and what that number is as a percentage of the world population                                                                     | Implement code to output report specified by user inputs | 5 | 3 |
| As a user, I want to receive a stable application                                                                                                                                                                                | Implement unit tests | 6 | 1 |
| (As Above)                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Implement integration tests | 6 | 1 |
